# Very Good Sneak Peak
Very Good is very good, but I hate clicking the items to see what they cost and who made them. This just puts a div overlay ontop of the images.

Pretty Simple.

1. download the repo
2. open "Extensions" page in Chrome
3. enable "Developer Mode"
4. Load Unpacked Extension
5. refresh Very Good, you're good...

# TODO:

Add a GUI so you can see what's happening.

# AwesomeTapesAwesomePlayer
Awesome Tapes from Africa is awesome. Clicking each song in order to play them is not. Awesome Player fixes that and auto-plays through the queue. Awesome.

Pretty Simple.

1. download the repo
2. open "Extensions" page in Chrome
3. enable "Developer Mode"
4. Load Unpacked Extension
5. navigaate to a page with mp3s on Awesome Tapes from Africa

The Chrome extension will autoplay the first song and loop through them.

# PHP

The php file is simply figuring out how the server wants to sign the mp3s so the player can correctly load them. Technically a totes hack, but whatevah.

# TODO:

Add a GUI so you can see what's happening.
